# Alphabet Soup

This is a working program, but it is not clean or finished professionally. I submit it now because I wanted to submit before
my interview today. I am able to clean up, unit test, write a proper readme, but I wanted to show a working version before 
my interview. Thank you for understanding. 

Run the program as follows:

```
./gradlew bootRun --args='src/test/resources/sample1.txt'
./gradlew bootRun --args='src/test/resources/sample2.txt'
./gradlew bootRun --args='src/test/resources/sample3.txt'
./gradlew bootRun --args='src/test/resources/sample4.txt'

```

The four inputs represent: 1) the provided input, 2) a larger input I found online, 3) a matrix with more rows than columns, and 4)
a matrix with more columns than rows. 

To repeat, the word search works. This is not something I would turn in as a complete product, but it works and I had limited time (few hours) before my interview. Thank you.
